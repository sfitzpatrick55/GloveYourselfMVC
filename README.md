# GloveYourself
By: `Scott Fitzpatrick`

## Description
GloveYourself is an easy-to-use ~~Blazor WASM~~ ~~Feature-packed MVC~~ MVC application that matches a user with the optimum hand protection based on their specific needs and hand size.

## Target audience
This app is perfect for anyone who needs help selecting the right glove for their project.

## Reasoning
I chose this project for several reasons; As an industrial designer, I have designed and developed a wide range of physical products, including hand protection. By developing this app, I hope to use hand protection as an example to showcase the full spectrum of my product development skills, from conceptual sketches of gloves to a full-stack application helping people interact with these gloves. Additionally, I plan to present this project to my current business partners in hopes that it will spark a discussion about the future of our products and the need to implement more technology.
